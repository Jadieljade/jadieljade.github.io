      i loveyou, you say, tangling up the three words in one breath. <br />i
      love you more, i tell you. no, iloveyoumore, you say. i love you more than
      bees love flowers, i say, and you tell me that bees love pollen and that
      youlovememore. but i love you, more than bees love flowers and yes, pollen
      and i love you more than birds love to sing more than wishes love stars
      more than dreams love sleep i love you more than grass loves rain and rain
      loves the earth and the earth loves trees and the trees love the wind.
      ilove you more than sunflowers love sun, more than the sun loves the sky,
      more than the sky loves blue, more than blue loves the sea. i love you
      ilove you iloveyou like youloveme.
